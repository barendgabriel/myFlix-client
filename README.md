myFlix Client

This is the client-side application for the myFlix movie app, built using React. The app allows users to view a list of movies fetched from an API. Each movie is displayed as a card with its title and image. Additionally, users can click on a movie to view detailed information about it.

1. Current Functionality:

- **Movie List**: Displays a list of movies fetched from the API.
- **Movie Cards**: Each movie card shows the title and image of the movie.
- **Individual Movie View**: When a movie card is clicked, users are navigated to a page displaying detailed information about the movie, including the title, description, genre, director, and year of release.
- **Back Button**: A back button is now available on the movie details page, allowing users to return to the movie list.

2. Next Steps:

- **Improve UI/UX**: Further enhance the user interface and experience, such as adding movie trailers, ratings, or reviews.
- **Additional Features**: Implement additional features like search and filters for the movie list.

3. Setup
