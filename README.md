myFlix Client
This is the client-side application for the myFlix movie app, built using React. The app allows users to view a list of movies fetched from an API. Each movie is displayed as a card with its title and image.

Current Functionality:
Movie List: Displays a list of movies fetched from the API.
Movie Cards: Each movie card shows the title and image of the movie.
No Individual Movie View: Currently, you can only see the list of movies. Clicking on a movie does not display its detailed information yet.
No Back Button: There is no functionality for returning to the movie list from a detailed movie view at the moment.
Next Steps:
Add Individual Movie View: Implement functionality to view detailed information about a single movie by clicking on a movie card.
Add Back Button: Implement a back button that allows users to return to the movie list from the individual movie view.
